Hey there, I'm Jaydeep, a lifelong learner with a passion for Tech Lead in IT Software Products. I've been in the industry for 5 years and have gained experience in ReactJS, Python, Django, PostgreSQL, SQL, and various AWS Services.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing football and other outdoor sports. I strongly believe that continuous learning is the key to personal and professional growth.

Take a look at my GitHub account, where you can find a variety of projects that showcase my skills and interests.

Feel free to connect with me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project. Thanks for stopping by!
